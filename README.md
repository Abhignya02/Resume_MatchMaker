# Resume_MatchMaker

This project addresses the crucial issue of resume-job description compatibility verification. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to develop a system that matches relevant skills mentioned in a resume to the required skills specified in a job description. Employers and job seekers will both benefit from this automated method, which will increase the speed and accuracy of the application process. It will also provide information on the areas in which candidates lack abilities and the reasons why a resume is not accepted for a position.
